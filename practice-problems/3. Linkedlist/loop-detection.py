''' 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-first-node-of-loop-in-a-linked-list/
find starting point of a loop in a linklist
1. If a loop is found, initialize slow pointer to head, let fast pointer be at its position.
2. Move both slow and fast pointers one node at a time.
3. The point at which they meet is the start of the loop.
check out the proof in above link
