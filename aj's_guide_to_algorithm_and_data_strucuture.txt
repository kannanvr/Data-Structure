Aj's guide for algorithms and data structures

Massive 90+ tutorials for beginners to advanced. This will help you in competitive problem solving and also in programming interviews. All the solutions are provided in C or C++. You can welcome to post the solutions in other languages.

This is the result for my past 6 months of hard work and sleepless nights that I have put into. I am now creating phase-2, which inludes even more complex algorithms. I shall complete them in coming months.
